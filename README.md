# Assignment Generator

The Assignment Generator was created as part of a thesis work at Ã“buda University, Hungary in 2019.

This project wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the hard work of the Stanford NLP Goup (https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/).
The application is built upon the Stanford Core NLP package (v3.9.2) (https://github.com/stanfordnlp/CoreNLP).
